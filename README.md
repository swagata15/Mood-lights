# Mood-lights
An Iot project to trigger different colored lights inside the room based on tweets sent from your phone.

This project was inspired by my friend who had colorful lights in his room. He wanted a way to automate them according to his mood. I designed a lamp, which can be controlled by the tweets he posts on twitter. The color acts as the trigger word - if he tweets pink, the lamp would turn pink. It also has a distance sensor which lights up the lamp as soon as he walks close to the lamp, and shuts off as he walks away from it.
